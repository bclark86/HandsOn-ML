It is also a good option if you have limited computing resources: once an online learning system has learned about new data instances, it does not need them anymore, so you can discard them (unless you want to be able to roll back to a previous state and \"replay\" the data). This can save a large amount of space. \n",

Paramter values are defined, a performance measure is specified, and either a utility function (how good the model is) or cost function (that measures how bad it is).

    "    + It takes a lot of data for most Machine Learning algorithms to work properly. Even for very simple problems you typically need thousands of examples, and for complex problems such as image or speech recognition you may need millions of examples (unless you reuse parts of an existing model). \n",
    "+ Nonrepresentative training data\n",
    "    + In order to generalize well to new data, the training data needs to be representative of the new cases you want to generalize to. Sampling bias can impact both instance-base and model-based learning. \n",
    "+ Poor-quality data\n",
    "    + If your training data is full of errors, outliers, and noise (e.g., due to poor quality measurements), it will make it harder for the system to detect the underlying patterns, so your system is less like to perform well. \n",
    "+ Irrelevant features\n",
    "    + Garbage in, garbage out. Your Machine Learning system will only be capable of learning if the training data contains enough relevant features and not too many irrelevant ones. A critical part of the success of a Machine Learning project is coming up with a good set of features to train on. Feature engineering involves feature selection, feature extraction (combining existing features), and creating new features. "

The training set is used to develop multiple models and models are selected and tuned based on how they perform on the validation set. The winning model is finally tested on the test set. This ensures that a model isn't selected based on its performance on the test set as doing so could lead to the selection of a model that adapted well to the test set but doesn't generalize well. "

    "To avoid \"wasting\" too much training data in validation sets, a common technique is to use cross-validation: the training set is split into complementary subsets, and each model is trained against different combination of these subsets and validated against the remaining parts. Once the model type and hyperparameters have been selected, a fiinal model is trained using these hyperparameters on the full training set and the generalization error is measured on the test set. "
