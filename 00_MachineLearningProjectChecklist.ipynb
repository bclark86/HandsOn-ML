    "    - To clean and prepare the test set\n",

    "    + Fix or remove outliers (optional).\n",

    "    + Discretize continuous features.\n",
    "    + Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.)\n",
    "    + Add promising transformations of features (e.g., log(x), sqrt(x), x^2, etc.).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fine-tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation:\n",

    "    + Unless there are very few hyperparameter values to explore, prefer random search over grid search. If training is very long, you may prefer a Bayesian optimization approach (e.g., using Gaussian process priors, as described by Jasper Snoek, Hugo Larochelle, and Ryan Adams (http://goo.gl/PEFfGr)).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Try Ensemble methods. Combining your best models will ofteen perform better than running them individually. \n",

    "    + Measuring performance may require a human pipeline (e.g., via a crowdsourcing service).\n",
